    <h1>USHBALL Predictor League</h1>
    <p>Yo {{name}},</p>
    <p>Four games in and there are 2 people on 6 points. The bragging rights are certainly not with me in my house at the moment.</p>
    <p>Shout out to Keith, Lazarus, Sean and Lynn with correct scores in the first four games.</p>
    <p>Today, we have four games and with a maximum of 12 points up for grabs, it's going to be interesting.</p>
    <p>There are some updates which now allow you to see your predictions as well as other peoples predictions. Click on the score board to see the results.</p>
    <p>The leaderboard will be updated through the day so you can see how you progressing, game be game.</p>
    <p>Good luck for today and make sure to get your predictions in by 22:59 for the following day. The default is a 0 - 0 score line.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
    <p>Darryl</p>
